* Paste a link to your [USERNAME].github.io repository.

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
Go to github.com.  On the right side of the screen, click a green box that says "new repository".  Type a name in the box with the blinking cursor.  Click the circle next to the word "Public".  Click the box next to the phrase "Initialize this repository with a readme".  Click the box near the bottom that says "Add a license".  Choose the MIT license.  Click the green box at the bottom that says "Create repository".  Copy the URL for the repository.  Next, open the terminal.  Navigate to the directory in which you want to clone the repository.  Type, "git clone " and paste the URL.

* Describe what open source means.
Open source means anyone can view and tamper with the source code for a program.  Anyone can play the Star Spangled Banner at a football game without paying a fee, because it is open source.  If you want to play a Lady Gaga song at a football game, you must pay a fee.

* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
The world at large benefits from many open source products.  However, if everything was open source, it would detract from knowledge workers' profit incentive, and technological development would stall because developers would need side gigs to feed themselves.  I prefer a happy medium with some stuff protected and some stuff open source.  I can see how some people might want everything open source.

* Assess the importance of using licenses.
Licenses protect you, your coworkers, and can help you make money.  They can also hurt you.  Lawyers can do a lot of things.  They know how to work the system. Beware.

* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
I have a website now!  I do not yet possess a reflexive fluency with git, so practicing manipulating branches does me good.  I'm moving, but I'm knee-deep in muck.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
Nope.  Those provided were sufficient.
