#1.1 Think About Time Reflection

- Which time management and productivity ideas did you learn about?
I learned about the Pomodoro technique, flow, and timeboxing.To be too concise, the Pomodoro technique is working on things for 25 minute stretches with 5 minute breaks.  “Flow” is being in the zone.  Flow is being immediately interested in what you are doing.  Timeboxing is similar to the Pomodoro technique, but the time frame doesn’t need to be 25 minutes.

- What is "Time Boxing?" How can you use it in Phase 0?
A time box is a predetermined duration of time dedicated to a specific task.  Time boxing is breaking down projects into manageable steps, or time boxes.  I will use time boxing in Phase 0 and beyond by telling myself, “I’m taking a break in an hour.”  This will make life seem more feasible, like climbing a mountain over a period of days, rather than trying to climb it in a few minutes.

- How do you manage your time currently?
Ha!  Kidding.  First, I go until I feel disinterested.  If I’ve been working on the current task for less than one hour, I finish up the hour.  Then, I take a ten minute break.  If I have been working on the task for at least one hour when I become disinterested, I will take a break immediately.  Sometimes, I’ll stay on target for hours, in which case, I’ll pause to drink water, eat, or do whatever I need to do so I can get back to the interesting thing.  When I’m in the zone, I like to protect that zone.  When we peer-pair, we’ll do whatever we need to do.  I’m flexible.

- Is your current strategy working? If not, why not?
My current strategy works for me, but I’ll do whatever I need to do when I’m working with a team, which may turn out to be most of the time.  Pomodoros sound fun.

- Can/will you employ any of them? If so, how? 
I will employ the Pomodoro technique.  I will estimate how much time a task will take (do software engineers do this successfully/consistently?).  Then, I’ll break the task down into 25 minute chunks and integrate those chunks into my schedule (including 5 minute breaks).  Lastly, I’ll execute.

- What is your overall plan for Phase 0 time management?
I will use the Pomodoro technique as described at [pomodorotechnique.com](www.pomodorotechnique.com)

#1.2 The Command Line Reflection

1) What is a shell? What is "bash?"

A shell is just an interface to a computer’s operating system.  When we say “shell,” we usually mean a command-line interface.  Bash is a shell that takes Unix commands.  Unix is an operating system.  OS X is a Unix-based operating system.

2) What was the most challenging for you in going through this material?

Despite learning something with each command, the pattern of learning became mundane.  I’m glad I did it, however.

3) Were you able to successfully use all of the commands?

Yes.  I needed a password for sudo, and I used sudo for chown.

4) In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know?

I feel that “cd”, “cd ..”, “ls”, and “pwd” are the most useful commands. “|” is an important argument to know.

5) Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head? Write what each does.
-pwd  This shows the directory you are in.
-ls  This lists the contents of a directory.
-mv  This moves and/or renames a file or folder from the first argument to the second argument.
-cd  This changes directories to the argument.
-../  This changes directories up one.
-touch  This makes a new empty file.
-mkdir  This makes a new empty directory.
-less  This shows you the contents of a file, one page at a time.  You can go forward with space, and back with w.  Use q to quit.
-rmdir  This removes a directory.  It must be empty.  To remove a non-empty directory, type “rm -rf ” followed by the directory name.
-rm  This removes a file.
-help  In bash, this tells you potentially useful stuff.  You can type “help ” plus a command to learn about a command.

#1.3 Forking and Cloning Reflection

* If you were going to write instructions for a new person on how to create a new repo, fork a repo, and clone a repo, what would they be? Why would you fork a repository as opposed to create a new one?
To create a new repo in GitHub, click a button with a "+" on it near the top right corner of your home screen.  Then, create a name, choose who you want looking at it (usually public), maybe a license, and any other options you see fit.

To fork a repo, find the repo you want to fork in GitHub.  Ensure you are not forking something in your own profile by checking the name of the repository near the top left corner of the screen.  Lastly, click the fork button near the top right corner of the screen.

To clone a repo, copy the URL from your repository you forked from someplace else.  In your terminal, navigate to the directory you want to contain the repo, then type "git clone " and paste the URL.  Press enter, and voila.

* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
I posses only a rudimentary, surface level understanding of git and GitHub.  To understand the complete depth of all things internet is a life-long pursuit.  Knowing what I need to know is the struggle.  I learned how to fork, clone, and create a repository from GitHub.
