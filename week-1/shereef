Shereef paints DBC to be a cornucopia of knowledge.  It seems like the sky is the limit.  I'm excited to see how this opportunity turns out.  DBC sounds like it is going to be fast paced, but not so much as to be compared to drinking from a fire hose.  I think we will be able to absorb the curriculum we are presented here, rather than just having the opportunity to glean what we think may be the most important.  Although, there will always be ample opportunity to learn more, should getting too far ahead of the pack turn out to be a problem (I don't see that as being a problem for myself).  I anticipate working with you other fiddler crabs.  I am a little nervous.  Perhaps anxious is a better word.  Nervous + excited = anxious.  The video changed my expectations some.  Shereef made an analogy, roughly stating that software engineering is to programming languages as architecture is to building materials.  Stuff like this clarifies the situation for me.  I hope I do not see an end to mind-blowing ideas in my life.  We won't at DBC.
