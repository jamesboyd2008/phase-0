How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

Having a pair smoothed out the process.  We were able to fill in the blanks for each other here and there.  It went quicker than it would have were I working solo.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

Yes.  I would have forgotten to include a footer, were it not for the wireframe.  Wireframes will be more useful for more complicated pages.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?

A simple wireframe is what we chose to work with.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?

I forgot about the footer element.  It makes the HTML easier to read at a glance.
