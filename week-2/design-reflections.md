* What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?

The six phases of web design are:
	information gathering,
	planning,
	design,
	development,
	testing and delivery, and
	maintenance.

* What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?

My site's purpose is to exhibit my super programming skills.  My site will feature my projects (including my blog and DBC stuff), contact info, and some personal info.

* What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?

My target audience is potential employers and programmers.

* What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? 

They will probably click on the *Projects* page.

* Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

I want them to contact me, if they see fit.  Before they do that, however, they will probably read a little about me, first.

* What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?

Someone should know to design their website to optimize the user experience, rather than to please a client or just make it look cool.  Some ways to improve user experience: keep the site efficient (less unnecessary data), and keep it the same across platforms.  They should also, however, make it look cool.  Some ways to make a site cool: include a color scheme, and keep it simple.

* What is user experience design and why is it valuable?

User experience is just that, what a user experiences on your site.  Can they quickly load the pages and find that for which they are looking?  Is it confusing?  User experience design is designing a web site, preferably from the get go, for optimal user experience, rather than for optimal initial client appreciation.

* Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

Figuring out the path to my site map image was tedious.  I imagine that managing a larger site map can get tedious.
