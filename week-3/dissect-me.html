				<h2>How does git help you keep track of changes?</h2> 
				So a lot can be covered in one week I have learned in the beginning of phase 	0 at Devbootcamp. So far we have gone over the basics of the command line, 	git, github and been introduced to some simple HTML outlines. The most 	important thing I learned was topics that look intimidating might not be as 	bad as you think with a little bit of effort.

				<h2>Why use GitHub to store your code?</h2>
				First we jumped into terminal and learned some basic commands. Playing around one can quickly understand how much faster it is to work with files through the shell. I went through the dbc curriculum as well as the Codecademy Learn Git course. Here are some of the commands I found particularly useful.

	      <h2>How does git help you keep track of changes?</h2>
	         Git is a program that allows users to work on multiple versions of the same file.  Those versions can be submitted to peers for review, then merged into the master copy of the project.  People can work on different portions of a file at the same time, then combine them.  This saves a lot of time.  Also, you can see what changes were made and when they were made, which aids tremendously in troubleshooting.

	      <h2>Why use GitHub to store your code?</h2>
	        GitHub allows thousands of programmers to view/edit the source code for thousands of programs, enabling immense amounts of collaboration and increased productivity for free.  Other version control systems are not as popular and/or cost money.  If the benefits are not immediately clear, they will be when robots are doing all our chores.

What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

<main>, <section>, and <header> are HTML5 tags we used in this challenge to which I return.  They make it easier for a developer to read the HTML. We also used <article> tags.

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

Everything has been laid out top-to-bottom so far.  I imagine this will more-or-less remain the case as we progress.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

I learned about snippets.  These will save time.  I also learned that you can highlight a chunk of text in sublime, press tab, and it will tab the text over, rather than repalcing the chunk of text with a few blank spaces.  Reviewing HTML is still very beneficial for me.  Also, I learned how to set the tab size.  I highly suspect I will create more snippets.  After Phase 0, I suspect I will use other people's snippets and templates when it's quicker.
