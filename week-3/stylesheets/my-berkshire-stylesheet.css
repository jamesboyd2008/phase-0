/*
What is important to know when linking 
an external file (like a stylesheet) to an HTML file?

It is important to know the path for the CSS file. 
We had to go up a directory using ../ in our HTML file.
It is good practice to link stylesheets in the head section of the HTML file.

What tricks did you use to help you with positioning? 
How hard was it to get the site as you wanted it?

We did a lot of trial and error.  
We looked up the values for the "position" and "display" properties multiple times.
It was tricky.  We spent 2 hours and 37 minutes on this.

What CSS did you use to modify the element style (like size, color, etc.)

We used font-size, font-weight, color, and font-famiy.
We used border-top and border-bottom as selector properties to replace <hr> tags.

Did you modify the HTML to include classes or ids? 

Yes.

If so, which did you choose and why? 

We used classes and ids to style our HTML, primarily for positioning.

If you didn't, how would you know which one to add to your HTML?

We made up our own names for classes and ids.  
Otherwise, we would be doing all of the stylization in HTML, which is bad practice.

When you compared your site to the actual code base, 
which do you think had cleaner code that followed best practices and why?

We had cleaner code because we used CSS.  
We followed best practice because we did our styling in a separate CSS file.
