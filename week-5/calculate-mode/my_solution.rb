# Calculate the mode Pairing Challenge

# I worked on this challenge with:

# I spent [] hours on this challenge.

# Complete each step below according to the challenge directions and
# include it in this file. Also make sure everything that isn't code
# is commented.



# 0. Pseudocode

# What is the input?
# What is the output? (i.e. What should the code return?)
# What are the steps needed to solve the problem?


# 1. Initial Solution




# 3. Refactored Solution




# 4. Reflection

# Which data structure did you and your pair decide to implement and why?
#
# Were you more successful breaking this problem down into implementable
# pseudocode than the last with a pair?
#
# What issues/successes did you run into when translating your pseudocode to code?
#
# What methods did you use to iterate through the content? Did you find any good
# ones when you were refactoring? Were they difficult to implement?
