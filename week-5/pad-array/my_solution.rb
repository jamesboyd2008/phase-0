# Pad an Array

# I worked on this challenge with:

# I spent [] hours on this challenge.


# Complete each step below according to the challenge directions and
# include it in this file. Also make sure everything that isn't code
# is commented in the file.



# 0. Pseudocode

# What is the input?
# What is the output? (i.e. What should the code return?)
# What are the steps needed to solve the problem?


# 1. Initial Solution
def pad!(array, min_size, value = nil) #destructive
  # Your code here
end

def pad(array, min_size, value = nil) #non-destructive
  # Your code here
end


# 3. Refactored Solution



# 4. Reflection

# Were you successful in breaking the problem down into small steps?
#
# Once you had written your pseudocode, were you able to easily translate
# it into code? What difficulties and successes did you have?
#
# Was your initial solution successful at passing the tests?
# If so, why do you think that is? If not, what were the errors you encountered
# and what did you do to resolve them?
#
# When you refactored, did you find any existing methods in Ruby to clean up your
# code?
#
# How readable is your solution?
# Did you and your pair choose descriptive variable names?
#
# What is the difference between destructive and non-destructive methods
# in your own words?
#
