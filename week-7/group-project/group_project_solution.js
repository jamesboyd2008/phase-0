/*
As a user, I want to use a function, "sum", that takes a list of numbers,
sums them all together, and gives me the combined total.

I want a different function, "mean", that takes a list of numbers,
and gives me the arithmetic mean of those numbers.  That is, the function
adds them all up, and divides that sum by the number of values given in
the original list.

I want a third function, "median", that takes a list of numbers,
and gives me the arithmetic median of those numbers.  If the list of numbers
contains an even number of values (having no middle value), it gives me
the average of the two middle numbers.
